FaceEngine:      Complete rewrite of the Face Classifier and Face Pipeline implementations.
                 There are significant improvements coming in 8.6.0. The pipelines have
                 been completely rewritten and are 25%-50% faster when using full CPU. The face
                 detector has also been improved to reduce false positives. There is a
                 completely new face classifier using cross-validating KNN and SVM internal
                 classifiers that increases matching accuracy even more.
                 Everything has changed between the UI and the DNN level, including the way we call the DNN models.
                 First, the pipelines have a whole new structure that allows us to dynamically scale the number of
                 worker threads based on load and the hardware.
                 Next, the way the images are loaded and converted to a format that OpenCV understands has changed.
                 8.5.0 was converting the images to BGR format and YuNet and SFace want RGB.
                 Another change is pipelines take better advantage of GPU processing. Images are moved to the GPU
                 for resizing and color format conversion. We’re also passing the GPU image to the DNN layer now so
                 DNN processing happens on the GPU via OpenCL.
                 The final big change is the face classifier which “matches” one face to another for recognition.
                 8.5.0 used a custom made K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier. In 8.6.0 we’re using an ensemble approach
                 using cross validating KNN and SVM classifiers from OpenCV with a single custom distance check.
                 It’s faster and more accurate.
                 In addition, we added a Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) which performs a minimum size check and
                 a Fast Fourier Transform filter to stop small, blurry, and noisy faces from being used for training
                 the recognition model.
                 The only thing we’re really reusing from 8.5.0 are the YuNet and SFace models themselves.
                 Removed old SSD and YOLOv3 DNN models.

AutoTags:        The Autotags engine has been completely rewritten using the new pipelines and improvements found
                 in the FaceEngine. New classifiers and the option to adjust the Autotagging confidence threshold
                 have been added. Autotagging is now faster and more accurate using new YOLOv11, YOLOv11 XLarge,
                 and EfficientNet B7 DNN models. The older YOLOv5 and ResNet-50 models have been removed.
                 Auto-tags scan tool is now available in the Tags tab from the left sidebar.

Image Quality    The Image Quality Sorter has been renammed to Image Quality Scanner. It is now available from the
                 Labels tab on the left sidebar. The global Image Quality settings from the setup dialog have been removed.

RedEyes:         RedEye Correction Filter tool has been updated to use an AI DNN model to detect eyes.
